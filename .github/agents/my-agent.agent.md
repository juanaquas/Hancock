steps context

The steps context contains information about the steps in the current job that have an id specified and have already run.
Property name	Type	Description
steps	object	This context changes for each step in a job. You can access this context from any step in a job. This object contains all the properties listed below.
steps.<step_id>.outputs	object	The set of outputs defined for the step. For more information, see Metadata syntax reference.
steps.<step_id>.conclusion	string	The result of a completed step after continue-on-error is applied. Possible values are success, failure, cancelled, or skipped. When a continue-on-error step fails, the outcome is failure, but the final conclusion is success.
steps.<step_id>.outcome	string	The result of a completed step before continue-on-error is applied. Possible values are success, failure, cancelled, or skipped. When a continue-on-error step fails, the outcome is failure, but the final conclusion is success.
steps.<step_id>.outputs.<output_name>	string	The value of a specific output.
Example contents of the steps context

This example steps context shows two previous steps that had an id specified. The first step had the id named checkout, the second generate_number. The generate_number step had an output named random_number.

{
  "checkout": {
    "outputs": {},
    "outcome": "success",
    "conclusion": "success"
  },
  "generate_number": {
    "outputs": {
      "random_number": "1"
    },
    "outcome": "success",
    "conclusion": "success"
  }
}

Example usage of the steps context

This example workflow generates a random number as an output in one step, and a later step uses the steps context to read the value of that output.
